	 	1. We need to create myLogger Object in the below format
 		2. static Logger myLogger = LogManager.getLogger(<ClassName>.class.getName()); -->
	  		The above peace of code will print the logs in console and as well in the Log4J Report which is 
	  		present under the folder with name "log4j2_Reports". Also note if the file size is more than 10MB 
	 		this will create a new folder.
 		3. Also, we can control what is getting logged by using the xml file. We have placed the XML File under "Resources" folder. Please refer online log4j for clear understanding.
 		   For Now you can use the update the values form "debug"->"trace" in xml file.
